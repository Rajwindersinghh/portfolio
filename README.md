## Challenges and Solutions

### Image Optimization and Responsiveness

One challenge was ensuring consistent image heights across different screen sizes. I addressed this by utilizing the `srcset`, `sizes`, and `picture` elements with the help of external styling and providing a responsive and optimized image view.

### Navbar Styling

Achieving a dark color for the navbar required custom styling. I overcame this challenge by using tailwind CSS class to create a `bg-dark`.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Optimization is Key:** I learned the importance of optimizing images and utilizing responsive design techniques to enhance performance.

2. **Custom Styling:** Customizing Bootstrap components with tailind and additional CSS allowed for a more personalized and polished appearance.

3. **Continuous Learning:** The web development landscape is constantly evolving. This project reinforced the need for continuous learning and adaptation.
